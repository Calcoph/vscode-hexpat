## Interesting token names

Some tokens will probably not be picked up by your theme,
so you should add them manually in your vscode configuration.

* `variable.language.dollar.hexpat` for the special `$` operator.
* `variable.language.parent.hexpat` for the keyword `parent`.

You can inspect all the tokens you need with vscode's `Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes`.
